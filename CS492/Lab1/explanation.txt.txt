Task 1: I avoided a deadlock situation by adding two more mutexes. The first I
called the `grab_mutex` which is locked to allow a philosopher to pick up (get
locks on) the forks to his left and right, the second I called the `drop_mutex`
and is locked to allow a philosopher to drop (unlock) both forks atomically.
This way the lock and unlock of the two mutexes becomes essentially atomic, so
if a philosopher is going to make any action on forks it will always be two of
them at a time.

Task 2: I allowed only 3 philosophers to attempt to eat at the same time by
adding a condition variable. When the philosopher attempts to pickup forks they
first check to make sure that there are not currently 3 philosophers attempting
to eat. If there are this philosopher does a `pthread_cond_wait` until one of
the others is done eating.
